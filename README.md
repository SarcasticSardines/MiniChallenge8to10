+ Create 3 APIs with endpoints
    1. Endpoint 1- Magic 8 Ball, outputs 8 unique responses
    2. Endpoint 2- Guess It game, has 3 endpoints for 3 different game modes (easy, medium, hard) with varying ranges based on difficulty chosen. User inputs a number to try and guess "secret" number
    3. Endpoint 3- Restaurant picker, takes an input and randomly outputs a restaurant from the category the user chose (out of 3 categories)

+ Review: The Magic 8 Ball and Resturaunt Picker endpoints work as intended. It could be me, especially since I couldn't figure out how to work it either, but there wasn't one discenrable answer for what the correct answer was. It seemed to change each time I inputted a number. Other than that, everything seems to work as intended. I really like how the Resturaunt Picker is handeled, with a number you pick 1-3 for a random lottery of resturaunt choices basead off of the number you pick.
